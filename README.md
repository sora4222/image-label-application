# Image Training Set Generator
This is intended to make a GUI that is capable of allowing the user to
sort a directory of images into a set of labelled images by putting them into a directory.
This will allow me to quickly make a dataset for the use of an ML pipeline and learn
how to write a GUI application in Go.
